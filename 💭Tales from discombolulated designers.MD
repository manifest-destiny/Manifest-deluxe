Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, Animate, Lightroom, InDesign. These are just some of the programs owned by Adobe. Adobe is a company that almost has a monopoly on the design industry today. When you buy an Adobe account, you pay a fixed price every month and then gain access to all their programs. But what if you only want Photoshop or Photoshop and After Effects, or just Premiere Pro? Unfortunately, that's not possible; you have one choice: pay money every month and get access to 2 programs you want and 20 other programs you'll never touch. This sounds awful, and it is. But there's hope: Blender for example! What can you do in Blender? Well, you can do practically everything offered in the Adobe package in Blender for the sum of 0 SEK. Blender is open source, which means that anyone who can program can contribute to improving the software and suggest completely new features to be incorporated. No one knows the software better than its own users, so why shouldn't they be directly involved in its development? No one knows the industry better than the industry itself. We need more programs like Blender, more programs that are open source-based, so that we can stop pouring our money into the endlessly deep dark hole called Adobe.

When I was younger and desperately wanted to get into digital illustration, I was put off by the daunting prices of the Abode programs. Every other professional illustrator and designer I saw on social media was using software like Photoshop and Illustrator and I just couldn’t afford it! The lack of information about free and open source software hindered my creative advances and my future as a designer was discouraging. There is a critical need for the sharing of accessible design tools and we as a community need to come together and build a space for all designers.
