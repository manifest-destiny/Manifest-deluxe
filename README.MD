👋 Intro

This is the open-source design manifesto. An initiative to inform and inspire a movement that moves away from opaque or paywalled software towards a more transparent and free internet. In a world where visual communication holds so much power, accessibility in graphic design is not just a luxury, but a fundamental right. 
At its core, graphic design is about communication. It shapes our perception and connects us with the world around us. However, when the tools we use to create design fail to consider the diverse needs of its audience, it becomes exclusionary, perpetuating inequalities and marginalizing voices. 

📜 Lore

Open-source means that the source-code is made free and accessible for anybody to use and modify. The programs made open-source are usually independently or community made. These softwares are mainly non-profit and rely on donations from the community to excel forward. 
One of the most significant barriers in graphic design is economical. The cost of industry-standard software and tools can be prohibitive, particularly for individuals and communities with limited resources. Access to quality education and training in design is also a challenge, further exacerbating disparities in the field. 

👀 Vision

We want open-source tools to be just as viable and widely used as today's industry standards. We also want to embrace open source software and tools, making them more readily available to all. Open source software not only lowers the economic barriers, but also promotes collaboration and innovation within the design community. No gatekeeping, share knowledge for free. 

🌱 Growing 

Make graphic design and programming education more accessible by creating community driven education initiatives and workshops. These programs should be inclusive and welcoming, providing opportunities for individuals to learn and grow as designers. As well as, incorporating open source methods in your creative process. 

📫 Contribute

You can either learn programming and become a direct contributor to the wide range of open source programs, or contribute by simply using the open source programs available and spreading the word. 

💞️ Collaborate

We should foster a sense of community and collaboration within the design space, to break down barriers and create pathways for aspiring designers to succeed. Being open to sharing the wealth of knowledge with your fellow creators, no gatekeeping. 

⚡ Call to action

This manifesto advocates for a shift toward accessible design practices, ensuring that nobody is left behind in the conversation. Break through the barriers of Adobes monopoly on the design world by contributing, collaborating and growing the open-source software ecosystem. Embrace design for all!
